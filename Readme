Version 1:

Tokens: 341/1024
Results Vs EvilBot: +40 =20 -0

Improvements:
- Implemented an evaluation method that simply counts up each player's material
- Implemented a basic minimax algorithm so my bot can see moves in the future
- Currently has a max search depth of 3, adding more depth takes too long.


Version 2:

Tokens: 469
Results Vs EvilBot: +20 =0 -0
Results Vs V1: +16 =3 -1

Impprovements:
- Implemented alpha-beta pruning to speed up the search. Increased depth to 4 from 3
- Implemented basic move priority by putting captures first in the moves array
- Decrease eval if the player is in check
- Immediately return 0 in minimax if the passed in position is a draw


Version 3:

Tokens: 522
Results Vs V2: +31 =5 -14
Results Vs V1: +15 =0 -1

Improvements:
- Replaced piece value dictionary with an int array to save tokens
- Use bitboard in evaluation function to quickly calculate total base piece values and in fewer tokens
- Implemented piece value charts using bitboard layers


Notes:
- lost to timeout 8 times in 50 games against V2
- Piece value charts do not account for board orientation, which leads to some interesting complications
- The piece value charts have somewhat arbitrary values that need to be significantly fine tuned
- Bot struggles to checkmate in one sometimes, which is very weird


Version 4:

Tokens: 556
Results Vs v3: +16 =2 -6
Results VS v2: +18 =2 -7

Improvements: 
- Added piece charts for black pieces and improved on the chart values
- Improved move priority simply by sorting by captured piece value
- Slightly altered piece values
- Got rid of missing mate in 1 issue

Notes:
- I am not sure why It didn't perform well against V2, although I am convinced this bot is stronger
- In order to fix the mate in 1 bug, I have to check for checkmate after initiating every move in the think funciton. I am not sure why this is neccisary 
- Still makes unsound sacrafices
