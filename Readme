Version 1:

Tokens: 341/1024
Results Vs EvilBot: +40 =20 -0

Improvements:
- Implemented an evaluation method that simply counts up each player's material
- Implemented a basic minimax algorithm so my bot can see moves in the future
- Currently has a max search depth of 3, adding more depth takes too long.


Version 2:

Tokens: 469
Results Vs EvilBot: +20 =0 -0
Results Vs V1: +16 =3 -1

Impprovements:
- Implemented alpha-beta pruning to speed up the search. Increased depth to 4 from 3
- Implemented basic move priority by putting captures first in the moves array
- Decrease eval if the player is in check
- Immediately return 0 in minimax if the passed in position is a draw


Version 3:

Tokens: 522
Results Vs V2: +31 =5 -14

Improvements:

Notes:
- lost to timeout 8 times in 50 games against V2
- Piece value charts do not account for board orientation, which leads to some interesting complications
- The piece value charts have somewhat arbitrary values that need to be significantly fine tuned
- Bot struggles to checkmate in one sometimes, which is very weird
